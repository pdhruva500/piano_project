                <h3>Cat Bear Cello</h3>
                <span class="platform">Amazon</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A housecat, a teddy bear, and a cello tell the story of a junior high school musician who learns a little about improvisation and a lot about expressing her true self. This is my first novel.</p>

                <h3>Rhythm Book 1</h3>
                <span class="platform">Sheet Music Plus</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a beginning music workbook that I wrote and use in my own teaching. Any music teacher (piano or otherwise) can use this workbook to teach a student about rhythm.</p>
            </a>

                <h3>Intros & Outros</h3>
                <span class="platform">Sheet Music Plus</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This book teaches beginning piano students how to add intros and outros to songs. I created it to use with my own students to grow their creativity and understanding of scales.</p>

                <h3>London Bridge</h3>
                <span class="platform">Sheet Music Plus</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">I arranged this beginning-level piano sheet music of the folk song. It uses a notehead-only notation style to simplify reading for students who already know how the rhythm should sound.</p>

                <h3>Functional Ear Trainer</h3>
                <span class="platform">Google Play</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">I recommend this ear training app because it focuses on how tones sound within scales rather than on individual intervals. I find the scale-centric method to be more efficient.</p>

                <h3>The Way To Stay In Destiny</h3>
                <span class="platform">Amazon</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a novel for middle school kids. It is a well-written story about a boy who loves piano and baseball but must deal with an uncle who doesn't understand him.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNLW723" target="_blank" class="link-card">
                <h3>The Forest Of Wool And Steel</h3>
                <span class="platform">Amazon</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a novel for adults. I recommend this because it is a beautifully written story about a young man in Japan who becomes a piano tuner.</p>
            </a>

                <h3>The Bear And The Piano</h3>
                <span class="platform">Amazon</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a children's picture book. I recommend this because both the plot and the pictures gorgeously illustrate the reward of learning music.</p>
            </a>

                <h3>Bud, Not Buddy</h3>
                <span class="platform">Amazon</span>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a novel for middle school kids. I recommend this because it is a compelling story about an orphan searching for his musician father.</p>
