        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin: 2rem 0;">This is a narrative of my experiences sharing music with a community of formerly unhoused people.</p>

        <p>Music has always been a way for me to connect with others and bring joy to different communities. When I had the opportunity to play piano at supportive housing facilities, I discovered the profound impact that live music can have on people who are rebuilding their lives.</p>

        <p>These experiences taught me that music transcends circumstances and speaks directly to the human spirit. Whether playing classical pieces, jazz standards, or popular songs, I witnessed how melodies could lift spirits, evoke memories, and create moments of peace and joy.</p>

        <p>Each performance was a reminder of why I became a music teacher in the first place: to share the transformative power of music with as many people as possible.</p>
